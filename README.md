>For enabling to start and stop ambulance siren use e and q keys (currently wav file gives error in other computers we will check and fix as soon as possible).

On the sample projects you can find a same named .wbt file we edited that world environment to use for testing our codes.

If you want to look at the codes or develop more features on the project : File> Open Text File and choose any .py 
or for using PyCharm on it you can follow this [manual](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide)
